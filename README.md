# Quantitative_fit_MS
Scripts for modelling and estimating the intensity of the signal and noise in MS data for analytes, as a function of concentration. Noise level and saturation effect are taken into account.

run with:
python MS_quant_analysis.py -o results

note that if you previously output the results in a given folder, the script will NOT overwrite them and stop instead.
Please specify a different output folder, or move or delete the results if you wish to rerun the analysis with the same output folder.
